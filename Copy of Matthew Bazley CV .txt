RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
MSC RESEARCH PROJECT | SCHMACK LAB - FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE | 2023-2024
A largely independent, self-contained project (under the guidance of a PhD student) on the effect of chemogenetic inhibition of striatal ChAT+ neurons on various performance metrics in an auditory detection task, as a readout of hallucination-like perception (repeated-measures design with injection and receptor controls)
·  Presented my findings to the Crick Neurophysiology department (in addition to the standard poster and presentation session as part of the UCL course)
·  Streamlined and optimised training on our low-throughput auditory detection (HALIP) task resulting in a decrease from roughly 3 to <2 months – this required meticulous record keeping of training progress and task parameters and consistently running daily behavioural sessions with mice (10am-6pm)
·  Analysis of training progress, behavioural and psychometric data in MATLAB
·  Basic wet lab work: making up batches of DCZ in DMSO/saline solution for injections; brain slice histology
·  Daily intraperitoneal injections in mice, practiced and performed to a high standard
·  Monitoring health, clinical signs and behaviour of 8 mice (especially vital due to complications from surgery and long-term water-restriction, which necessitated liaising with the BRF and vet). Recording procedures, weights and clinical changes on MCMS platform. PIL licence (A, B and C)
·  Gained insight into the process and challenges of clinical research with psychiatric patients and the Prolific platform
·  Placing orders for shared/personal items for the lab and liaising with suppliers and upheld the organisational standards of the lab
                                                        
EDUCATION
MSC NEUROSCIENCE | UCL | 2022-2024                                                               · High 2:1 (68%) | Dissertation project (above) awarded first class        
BSC BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES | UCL | 2019-2022
·  High 2:1 (68%) | Dissertation/writing modules (75% and 68%)
· ‘Early Development of Pain in Humans’, supervised by Prof. Maria Fitzgerald
·  Won best lab technique presentation prize (PHOL0004)
                                                        
EXTRACURRICULAR        
·  Neuroscience/science articles published in Pi Media, the largest UCL magazine, with one article selected for print        
·  Produced information packs for volunteers at UCL and UCLH for a student-led blood donation initiative. I worked within a small team in its early stages, where I was also responsible for liaising with the student union to get approval for risk assessment documents and advertising        
·  UCL Effective Altruism Society (2021-2022) - as Events Officer (and Welfare Officer) I helped organise fellowships, events and talks on topics ranging from biosecurity, rationality, cognitive bias, existential risk and AI alignment.
·  Alongside my studies, I also took part in an intensive 6-month fellowship on Existential Risk, run by a Cambridge PhD student.
·  Selected for two UCL PhD group mentorship programs (2021-22)
        · Bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy: Weekly sessions on relevant papers and
        laboratory techniques used in the pain field. My research specifically focused on the role of
        ion channels, culminating in a 2,000-word report and presentation to the society
        · A neuroscience journal club involving weekly group discussions of papers and
        sessions on experimental techniques in neuroscience. I produced a review and
        presented to the society on the effect of stress on adult neurogenesis. Since
        then, I have remained in a regular neuroscience journal club of PhD students from a
        diverse range of academic backgrounds
· Genomics course at BioGrad diagnostics (2018) - to refine/practice PCR skills and introduction to using Primer-BLAST and the NCBI nucleotide databases
IBSTOCK PLACE SCHOOL | 2007 -2017
· AAA at A2 in Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics | 10 A* at IGCSE
